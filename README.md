# My Garden - v1
### _First try with Builder_

The [Builder](https://builder.decentraland.org) provides an easy way for anyone to design a scene within Decentraland.  I built this scene based on the tutorial in the first reference below.

## Before you start

Please make sure you have the latest version of the Decentraland SDK installed by running the following command in the terminal:

```
npm install -g decentraland
```

## Running the scene

Inside the terminal, run the following command to rn the scene: 

```
dcl start
```

This will install any missing dependencies and automatically open your default browser to preview the scene. This might take a few seconds to load but once done, you should see a wooden bridge situated in a small garden that's surrounded by wooden fences and pine trees.

You need to walk around the fence and find the wooden door.  You can't access the garden without having to jump over the fence so you have the door open and close the wooden door by clicking on it.
